  # Have editor/IDE/OS specific files you need to ignore? Consider using a global gitignore: 
  #
  # * Create a file at ~/.gitignore
  # * Include files you want ignored
  # * Run: git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
  #
  # After doing this, these files will be ignored in all your git projects,
  # saving you from having to 'pollute' every project you touch with them
  #
  # Not sure what to needs to be ignored for particular editors/OSes? Here's some ideas to get you started. (Remember, remove the leading # of the line)
  #
  # For MacOS:
  #
  #.DS_Store
  #
  # For TextMate
  #*.tmproj
  #tmtags
  #
  # For emacs:
  #*~
  #\#*
  #.\#*
  #
  # For vim:
  #*.swp

  Description goes here.
  
  == Contributing to <%= project_name %>
  
  * Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
  * Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
  * Fork the project
  * Start a feature/bugfix branch
  * Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
  * Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
  * Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
